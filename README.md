# memory-card

[Live Demo](https://stevenwalker91.github.io/memory-card/)

My second React project using functional components this time rather than class. The purpose of the game is for users to get as high a score as possible by selecting cards. The game ends when the user selects a card they've previously selected. It's harder than it sounds, I didn't get past about 15!

I found this project a little easier after learning a lot of React principles through the first project. I didn't really have an opportunity/need to use hooks as an alternative to life cycle methods (e.g. `useEffect` however so need to explore how I can incorporate this into a future project.

All in all, I much prefer the functional approach to components than the class approach.
