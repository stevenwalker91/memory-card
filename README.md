My second React project using functional components this time rather than class. Found this one a little easier after learning a lot of React principles through the first project. I didn't really have an opportunity/need to use hooks as an alternative to life cycle methods (e.g. `useEffect` however so need to explore how I can incorporate this into a future project.

All in all, I much prefer the functional approach to components than the class approach.a
